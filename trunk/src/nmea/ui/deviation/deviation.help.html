    <h1>Deviation Curve</h1>
    <p>
      The generic equation of a deviation curve is
      <pre>
 a + (b.sin(Z)) + (c.cos(Z)) + (d.sin(2.Z)) + (e.cos(2.Z))      
      </pre>
      where <b>Z</b> is the magnetic heading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the icon <img src="open.png"> to open an already defined deviation curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <font color="red"><b>red points</b></font> on the screen are the one stored as the deviation curve.
      <br>
      You can drag the points horizontally on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>To define your own deviation curve</h2>
      Use the icon <img src="importIcon.png"> to load logged NMEA data. The points must have been looged in a sheltered place, with no current,
      to make sure that the difference between the Course Over Ground (COG) and Magnetic Heading (HDG) will be the value of the compass deviation (d).
      <br>
      The logged data points appear in yellow on the display. <i>Note:</i> The logged values for the heading are Integers.
      <br>
      When the "Auto Set" box is cheched, the points in red are representing the <i>average</i> value of the deviation for each heading.
      <br>
      Again, the red points are the points stored for the representation and definition of the deviation curve.
      <br>
      The red points can be dragged with the mouse (the pointer's shape will change when the point is draggable i.e. when the mouse is on a draggable point).
      <br>
      The yellow curve is the result of a smoothing operation (least squares method) based on the logged and sprayed points.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can: 
      <ul>
        <li type="disc">Delete unwanted points. Check the "Del." check box, and use the mouse to drag a rectangle around the points you want to drop</li>
        <li type="disc">Add more points. Check the "Spray" checkbox, and use the mouse (left-click) to spray points on the screen</li>
        <li type="disc">Suggest a smoothed curve ("Auto Set." checkbox)</li>
      </ul>
      When you hit the "Move points" button, you actually move the red points (defining the deviation curve) on the yellow smoothed curve.      
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note</i>
      <br>
      The boxes "Auto Set", "Spray" and "Del." are visible and available only when logged data have been imported.
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>
        <b><i>Important</i></b>
        <br>
        When you are done, do not forget to <b>save</b> your work, <img src="save.png">.
        <br>
        You will give a name to the curve you save; points will be saved as a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file.
        <br>
        Once saved, make sure this file is loaded. Use the Open <img src="open.png"> icon to do so, if the name
        you gave is different from the currently loaded one.
        <br>
        For this choice to be persisted and available next time you re-open the console, use the menu File &gt; Save Calibration Parameters.
